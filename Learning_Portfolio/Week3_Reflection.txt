Learning:

I worked hard this week to finish Assignment 1, which required me to analyze a set of Australian radio discussion transcripts. To complete the project, I had to use Python to explore, analyze, alter, visualize, and interpret text data using various NLP techniques. I also had to put my findings together in a Markdown report. I was able to hone my abilities in exploratory data analysis, tokenization, and text pretreatment by working on this project. Additionally, I developed my storytelling and sense-making skills, which are crucial for effectively conveying data insights. This ability was especially crucial for developing a story that effectively communicated the importance and worth of my research.

Challenges faced and how I overcame them:

One of the key challenges was handling the unstructured nature of the dataset and deciding which preprocessing steps were necessary for analysis. Furthermore, choosing a clear narrative that would make the technical analysis interesting and approachable was difficult because the task placed a strong emphasis on storytelling. I tried a number of preprocessing strategies to overcome the difficulties, including tokenization, stopword removal, and term normalization to account for geographical variances. To better understand the recurring themes and word patterns, I also used word clouds and bar charts to visualize the data. To produce a coherent narrative for the storytelling component, I organized my report around important questions, such as what the data shows about regional dialects or subjects of popular interest.
